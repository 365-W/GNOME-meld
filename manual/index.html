<h2>Getting started</h2>

<p>
Open up two files, original and modified.<br>
Location of the changes is summarised in the left and right margins. More detailed
differences are shown in the text and central pane.
</p>

<p>
You can scroll through the changes
through the scrollbar or text, but the quickest way is by using the mouse wheel over
the central bar to skip between changed sections. 
</p>

<p>
You can apply changes by clicking the merge buttons ("&gt;&gt;" and "&lt;&lt;").
Or for more detailed changes simply edit the text inplace and the diffs automatically
update.
</p>

<p>
Save a file by clicking in it and pressing Control+s or by selecting
file-&gt;save&gt;save file. The save button on the toolbar saves the file
which has focus.
</p>

<p>
Control+W to close current tab and control+Q to quit the app.
</p>

<p>
Messages such as being unable to load or save files appear in the status
bar in the bottom of the window.
</p>
