<title>What is Meld?</title>
<p>
<app>Meld</app> is a tool for comparing files and directories, and for
resolving differences between them. It is also useful for comparing changes
captured by version control systems.
</p>

<p>
<app>Meld</app> shows differences between two or three files (or two or three
directories) and allows you to move content between them, or edit the files
manually. <app>Meld</app>'s focus is on helping developers compare and merge
source files, and get a visual overview of changes in their favourite version
control system.
