Meld is extremely easy to install - just untar and run. No need to configure or
build. Unfortunately the python libs which meld depends on have not made it
into many distributions so you may need to install those.

You will need at least.
 * orbit-python-1.99.0
 * pygtk-1.99.15
 * gnome-python-1.99.15
Meld will not work with earlier versions of these packages.

They are all available from your favourite gnome mirror.  Redhat users note
that Rawhide currently has {pygtk,gnome-python2)-1.99.15.  Meld currently needs
an RPM packager.

If building from source, be careful to watch for messages like 'libfoo-2.0.pc
not found' when running configure - you may need to install extra gnome
development packages to correctly build.  

If you are using gCvs, meld can be used as the external diff program.
