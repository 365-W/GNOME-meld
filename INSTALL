## Install
## *******
##
## Meld can be installed in two ways:
## 
##   Run directly from untar directory:
##   "make" to create translations
##   Now run "./meld"
##   You can create a symlink to the executable
##   i.e. /usr/local/bin/meld -> <melddir>/meld
##
##   OR
##
##   Install into (for instance) /usr/local
##   "make prefix=/usr/local install"
##   Now run "/usr/local/bin/meld"
## 
##   You can customise the install paths used here:
prefix := /usr/local
bindir := $(prefix)/bin
libdir := $(prefix)/lib
docdir := $(prefix)/share/doc
sharedir := $(prefix)/share
localedir := $(prefix)/share/locale
libdir_ := $(libdir)/meld
docdir_ := $(docdir)/meld
sharedir_ := $(sharedir)/meld
helpdir_ := $(sharedir)/gnome/help/meld
## 
## Python Version
## **************
## 
## Meld will run with either python2.2 or python2.3. There are several
## advantages to running python2.3 however. Pythons difflib has had its worst
## case behaviour improved massively - in some cases this can result in a 300x
## (times not percent!) speedup in meld. Python2.3 has universal newline
## support so you can easily compare unix/windows/mac files without
## conversion.
## 
## Dependencies
## ************
## 
## For best results, use version 2.0 or above of the following packages.
## At the very least you will need:
##  * pyorbit-1.99
##  * pygtk-1.99.15
##  * gnome-python-1.99.15
## 
## Optional:
##  * pygtksourceview 0.9 or higher
##    (http://sourceforge.net/projects/pygtksourceview)
##  * or pysourceview 1.0.1 (no longer maintained. 1.0.0 does not work)
## 
## Meld will not work with earlier versions of these packages.
## 
## They are all available from your favourite gnome mirror.
## Alternatively many distributions provide binary packages.
## 
## If building from source, be careful to watch for messages like
## 'libfoo-2.0.pc not found' when running configure - you may need to
## install extra gnome development packages to correctly build.  
## 
## If you are using gCvs, meld can be used as the external diff program.
