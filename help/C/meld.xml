  <chapter id="filecompare">
    <title>File Comparison</title>

    <sect1 id="filecompare_starting">
      <title>Starting</title>

      <para>Use <guimenu>File...-&gt;New...-&gt;File Comparison</guimenu> to
      start a new file comparison. You can compare two or three files.</para>

      <para>For two way comparisons the original is shown in the left pane and
      the modified version in the right pane by convention.</para>

      <para>For three way comparisons, the original is shown in the centre
      pane and the left and right panes show the modified versions. By
      convention we put the locally modified file in the right pane.</para>
    </sect1>

    <sect1 id="filecompare_summary">
      <title>Change Summary</title>

      <para>The location of the changes is summarised in the window margins at
      the far left and right. By default green marks insertions and deletions
      and blue marks changes.</para>

      <para>You can jump to an individual change by clicking in the margin or
      using the scrollbar.</para>
    </sect1>

    <sect1 id="filecompare_detailed">
      <title>Detailed View</title>

      <para>Detailed differences are shown in the text and central pane.
      Inserted text is shown with a solid background. Lines containing changes
      are marked with a light background with the individual changes
      highlighted with a stronger colour.</para>

      <para>The area between each file shows where each change occurs in the
      other file. You can scroll through the changes by rolling the mouse
      wheel over this area or with keyboard shortcuts
      <keysym>Control+D</keysym>, <keysym>Control+E</keysym>.</para>
    </sect1>

    <sect1 id="filecompare_editing">
      <title>Editing</title>

      <para>You can edit the files as you would in a normal text editor. The
      differences will update automatically. Use <keysym>Control+F</keysym> to
      search and <keysym>Control+G</keysym> to repeat the last search.</para>

      <para>You can also apply changes by clicking the merge buttons
      ("<guiicon>-&gt;</guiicon>" and "<guiicon>&lt;-</guiicon>"). Holding
      <keysym>Shift</keysym> allows blocks to be deleted. Holding
      <keysym>Control</keysym> allows the current change to be inserted before
      or after the other change.</para>

      <para>You can apply all the changes from a given file by
      <mousebutton>right clicking</mousebutton> a text pane and choosing
      <command>Copy all left</command> or <command>Copy all right</command>.
      You can also launch an external editor from this menu. Configure the
      external editor in
      <guimenu>Settings-&gt;Preferences-&gt;Editor</guimenu></para>
    </sect1>

    <sect1 id="filecompare_filtering">
      <title>Filtering</title>

      <para>You can ignore certain types of differences in order to locate
      important differences. All these settings are available from
      <guimenu>Settings-&gt;Preferences-&gt;Text Filters</guimenu>.</para>

      <sect2>
        <title>Regular Expressions</title>

        <para>When comparing files, each selected regular expression is run in
        turn over each file. Anything matching the expression is replaced by
        the empty string before comparison is performed.</para>

        <warning>
          <para>Replacement typically happens on several lines at a time. The
          input string will likely contain newline characters (\n). If your
          regular expression matches newlines the comparison will be
          incorrect. (The technical reason is that incremental difference
          updates with multiline text replacement is tricky and not yet
          implemented.)</para>
        </warning>

        <para><note>
            <para>See the python re module for more information on regular
            expressions</para>
          </note></para>
      </sect2>

      <sect2>
        <title>Blank Lines</title>

        <para>Changes which insert or remove blank lines can be ignored. This
        option is most useful in conjunction with one or more regular
        expression filters.</para>
      </sect2>
    </sect1>

    <sect1 id="filecompare_saving">
      <title>Saving</title>

      <para>When you have unsaved changes, a disk icon will appear beside the
      file name of the changed file. The tab label and window title also have
      an asterix after the file name.</para>

      <para>Save a file pressing <keysym>Control+s</keysym>, by selecting
      <guimenu>File-&gt;Save</guimenu> from the menu or by the toolbar save
      button. All of these save the currently focussed file (the file
      containing the edit cursor)</para>
    </sect1>

    <sect1 id="filecompare_status">
      <title>Status Bar</title>

      <para>The status bar shows the cursor location (line and column) and
      also progress messages as files are initially loaded and
      compared.</para>
    </sect1>
  </chapter>

  <chapter id="foldercompare">
    <title>Folder Comparison</title>

    <sect1 id="foldercompare_starting">
      <title>Starting</title>

      <para>Use <guimenu>File...-&gt;New...-&gt;Directory Comparison</guimenu>
      to start a new directory comparison. You can compare two or three
      directories.</para>

      <para>For two way comparisons the original is shown in the left pane and
      the modified version in the right pane by convention.</para>

      <para>For three way comparisons, the original is shown in the centre
      pane and the left and right panes show the modified versions. By
      convention we put the locally modified file in the right pane.</para>
    </sect1>

    <sect1 id="foldercompare_summary">
      <title>Change Summary</title>

      <para>Similarly to the file comparison, the window margins mark file
      deletions, creations and modifications.</para>

      <para>You can jump to an individual change by clicking in the margin or
      using the scrollbar.</para>
    </sect1>

    <sect1 id="foldercompare_detailed">
      <title>Detailed View</title>

      <para>Modified files are highlighted with red, created files with green
      and deleted files with a strikethrough. See also <xref
      linkend="dir_content_filtering" /></para>

      <para>The file or folder most recently modified has a red dot
      superimposed on its icon. More detailed information such as file
      permission and modification time can be seen in the status bar when a
      file is selected.</para>

      <para>Use the mouse or the the cursor keys <keysym>Up</keysym>,
      <keysym>Down</keysym>, <keysym>Left</keysym> and <keysym>Right</keysym>
      to navigate. Additionally <keysym>Control+D</keysym> and
      <keysym>Control+E</keysym> move to the next and previous modification
      respectively.</para>
    </sect1>

    <sect1 id="foldercompare_editing">
      <title>Editing</title>

      <para>Activate an item with <mousebutton>double click</mousebutton> or
      <keysym>Return</keysym> to start an individual file comparison.</para>

      <para>Additional options are available from a <mousebutton>right
      click</mousebutton> context menu.</para>

      <para>Use <mousebutton>Shift+Click</mousebutton> and
      <mousebutton>Control+Click</mousebutton> to select multiple
      items.</para>
    </sect1>

    <sect1 id="foldercompare_filtering">
      <title>Filtering</title>

      <para>Often the initial comparison will contain too much spurious
      information. You can use filters to isolate the differences which are
      important to you.</para>

      <sect2>
        <title>Explicit Hiding</title>

        <para>Use the toolbar button to hide an item (and all subitems for
        directories).</para>
      </sect2>

      <sect2>
        <title>Case Sensitivity</title>

        <para>By default filename comparisons are case sensitive. Use the
        toolbar button to toggle case sensitivty of filenames.</para>
      </sect2>

      <sect2>
        <title>State Filtering</title>

        <para>All items have a state which is one of: <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para>Modified (there is some content difference between files
              which are present)</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>New (there is no content difference between present files,
              but the file is missing from at least one directory)</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>Identical (all files have equal content and are all
              present)</para>
            </listitem>
          </itemizedlist></para>

        <para>Use the toolbar buttons to control which items are shown by
        their state.<note>
            <para>In the current version, only files are filtered by state.
            Directories are always shown.</para>
          </note></para>
      </sect2>

      <sect2>
        <title>Name Filtering</title>

        <para>You can hide selected filename patterns from the comparison
        using the toolbar buttons. Use
        <guimenu>Settings-&gt;Preferences-&gt;File Filters</guimenu> to
        customise the file patterns.</para>
      </sect2>

      <sect2 id="dir_content_filtering">
        <title>Content Filtering</title>

        <para>If differences between files exist, but all differences match
        the active regular expressions specified in
        <guimenu>Settings-&gt;Preferences-&gt;Text Filters</guimenu>, then the
        filename is not highlighted in red, but is insted italicised in
        regular font.</para>

  </chapter>

  <chapter id="sourcecontrol">
    <title>Source Control</title>

    <sect1 id="sourcecontrol_starting">
      <title>Starting</title>

      <para>Use <guimenu>File...-&gt;New...-&gt;CVS Browser</guimenu> or
      <guimenu>File...-&gt;New...-&gt;SVN Browser</guimenu> to start browsing
      a working copy.</para>

      <para>The browser is used for examining and commiting or reverting local
      changes. It is not intended to be a complete source control
      client.</para>
    </sect1>

    <sect1 id="sourcecontrol_filtering">
      <title>Filtering</title>

      <para>The browser can filter on four states:<itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>Normal (the file is unchanged since it was checked
            out)</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Non controlled (the file exists locally but was not checked
            out)</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Ignored (the file is explicitly ignored e.g. though
            .cvsignore)</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Modified (locally changed, added or removed)</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist></para>

      <para>If you have several changes scattered in several directories or in
      a large tree, the 'Recurse' tooggle is flattens the directory listing.
      This is especially useful in conjunction with only the modified filter
      active.</para>
    </sect1>

    <sect1 id="sourcecontrol_viewing">
      <title>Viewing Differences</title>

      <para>Activating an unmodified file opens it in the file viewer.
      Activating a modified file opens up a two way diff to examine your
      changes.</para>

      <para>You can examine many changes at once using
      <mousebutton>Shift+Click</mousebutton> and
      <mousebutton>Control+Click</mousebutton> to select multiple
      items.</para>
    </sect1>

    <sect1 id="sourcecontrol_changes">
      <title>Making Changes</title>

      <para>The toolbar contains commands to perform the most common source
      control operations. These operations are also accessible through a
      context menu.</para>
    </sect1>

    <sect1 id="sourcecontrol_console">
      <title>Viewing Console</title>

      <para>At the bottom of the source control window is an expander
      containing all the source control operations and their output. Click the
      expander bar to toggle between hiding and showing the console.</para>
