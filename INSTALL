Install
*******

Meld can be installed in two ways:

1) Run directly from untar directory:
   "make" to create translations
   Now run "meld"

2) Install into (for instance) /usr/local
   "make prefix=/usr/local install"
   Now run "/usr/local/bin/meld"

Dependencies
************

For best results, use version 2.0 or above of the following packages.
At the very least you will need:
 * pyorbit-1.99
 * pygtk-1.99.15
 * gnome-python-1.99.15

Meld will not work with earlier versions of these packages.

They are all available from your favourite gnome mirror.
Alternatively many distributions provide binary packages.

If building from source, be careful to watch for messages like 'libfoo-2.0.pc
not found' when running configure - you may need to install extra gnome
development packages to correctly build.  

If you are using gCvs, meld can be used as the external diff program.
