<h2>Getting started (Diff2 and Diff3)</h2>

<p>
Open up two files, original and modified.<br>
Location of the changes is summarised in the left and right margins. More detailed
differences are shown in the text and central pane.
</p>

<p>
You can scroll through the changes
through the scrollbar or text, but the quickest way is by using the mouse wheel over
the central bar to skip between changed sections. 
</p>

<p>
You can apply changes by clicking the merge buttons ("-&gt;" and "&lt;-"). Holding
control allows diffs to be deleted. Shift allows the current change to be inserted
before or after the other change.
For more detailed changes simply edit the text inplace and the diffs automatically
update.
</p>

<p>
Save a file by clicking in it and pressing Control+s or by selecting
file-&gt;save&gt;save file. The save button on the toolbar saves the file
which has focus.
</p>

<p>
Control+W to close current tab and control+Q to quit the app.
</p>

<p>
Messages such as being unable to load or save files appear in the status
bar in the bottom of the window.
</p>

<h2>CVS browsing</h2>

<p><b>CVS browsing is under development - if you want to try it, I recommend running
meld from a console so you can see diagnostic messages</b></p>

<p>
Click the cvs button to open up a new CVS browser tab. By default only files under
CVS control are shown. To see all files click the 'Unknown' filter button. You can also
show only locally modified files by clicking the 'Modified' filter button. If you have
several changes scattered in several directories, the 'Recurse' tooggle is flattens
the directory listing.
</p>

<p>
Clicking on an unmodified file opens it in the file viewer. Clicking a modified file
opens up a two way diff to examine your changes.
</p>

<p>
You can examine many changes at once by clicking on a one or more directories and/or
files and clicking the diff button.
